        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a pizza recipe I've found in the internet that I cant remember where its from.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>1st batch:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400g warm water</li>
            <li>10g dry yeast</li>
            <li>20g sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2nd batch:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>680g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>20g olive oil </li>
            <li>15g salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the yeast and sugar to the warm water. The water should be around 40°C, otherwise the yeast wont activate (they die). While the yeast is activating, you can measure the ingredients from the second batch.</li>
            <li>With the yeast activated (there should be foam visible), add the flour, olive oil and salt to the bowl. Mix the dough roughly and let it rest for 30 minutes covered, as this will make the dough stick less to the hands.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough inside a large bowl, or at the countertop. Let it ferment for 60 minutes covered, preferably inside an oven with just the lights on.</li>
            <li>Portion the dough in 3 separate balls for 35cm pizzas, and let them rest for 15 more minutes. While waiting, preheat the oven at 250°C.</li>
            <li>Open the dough on a pizza tray, add the tomato sauce, cheese, and finally, the pepperoni slices.</li>
            <li>Bake at 230°C for 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
